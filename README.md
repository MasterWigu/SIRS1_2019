# SIRS 2019/2020 - Group 13

## Automatic Vulnerability Detector
"The leader of your group of hackers decided to create a scoring system that rewards the
members for any new vulnerabilities that they manage to find. With that goal in mind, he
implemented a system that allows members to submit their attacks and gain points.
As a member, you decided to create a program that automatically searches for
vulnerabilities in binaries in order to win this intra-group competition!
Your project should provide the following components:
* Compute fingerprinting of binaries through input/output interaction
* Automatically detect common vulnerabilities like calls to "gets" functions or to
printf-family functions with user controlled buffers.
* Submit fingerprinting and vulnerabilities to score points.
* Receive and store vulnerabilities from group members
* The leader of the group should be able to see the scoreboard and the exploits of
each member.
* Hackers should not be able to see other peopleâ€™s attacks or submit bad attacks for
someone else. Basically, try to prevent any kind of cheating.
The primary focus of the system should be the scoring system integrity and information
confidentiality.
For the secondary functionality (vulnerability detector) you can choose an existing tool
such as the ones below, or implement a rudimentary solution yourself."

to find inputs that crashes binaries, among other things.

vulnerabilities and create exploits mostly automatically.

## Execution
On the *Setup* folder run:
```bash
vagrant up --provision
```

After this, when the machines are up, it will open a virtual machine that is the client, and will ask for the credentials:
login: **vagrant** and password: **vagrant**.
When logged in just enter the command to initialize the interface:
```bash
./client/gui.sh
```

 Interface
After initializing the interface Xfce, open the Firefox app and open the web site https://192.168.50.10. This will open the scoreboard web interface.


After logging in, the user should be able to see his/her submitted vulnerabilities and see the number of points of every user of the scoreboard. If the user is a leader, he/she can also see the submitted vulnerabilites of every user and promote/demote other users to the rank of leader.
There is already one leader with user: **admin** and password: **root**.


If the client wants to submit a vulnerability, it is needed to install angr and cryptography in a python virtual envirovment (the virtual envirovment is recommended by angr). Run the following command:
```bash
mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) angr && python3 -m pip install angr cryptography
```
If your analysing program needs another python package, you can install it now.

After the installation, to run the vulnerability detector and submit the vulnerability simply run:
```bash
python3 VulnDetector.py
```
Once the program starts input the angr launch file. An input program we provided is `angrVuln2`. Just input the name of the angr file you want. Note that the angr file must have a main() function that returns the fingerprint. both the angr file and the binary that is to be analysed must be in the same folder as the `VulnDetector.py` and the `customClient.py`.
Then just insert the explaination for the vulnerbility found and the username and password for the user.

After the submission of the vulnerability, you can check that the vulnerability was submitted on the website.
