# SIRS 2019/2020 - Group 13

## Automatic Vulnerability Detector
"The leader of your group of hackers decided to create a scoring system that rewards the
members for any new vulnerabilities that they manage to find. With that goal in mind, he
implemented a system that allows members to submit their attacks and gain points.
As a member, you decided to create a program that automatically searches for
vulnerabilities in binaries in order to win this intra-group competition!
Your project should provide the following components:
* Compute fingerprinting of binaries through input/output interaction
* Automatically detect common vulnerabilities like calls to "gets" functions or to
printf-family functions with user controlled buffers.
* Submit fingerprinting and vulnerabilities to score points.
* Receive and store vulnerabilities from group members
* The leader of the group should be able to see the scoreboard and the exploits of
each member.
* Hackers should not be able to see other peopleâ€™s attacks or submit bad attacks for
someone else. Basically, try to prevent any kind of cheating.
The primary focus of the system should be the scoring system integrity and information
confidentiality.
For the secondary functionality (vulnerability detector) you can choose an existing tool
such as the ones below, or implement a rudimentary solution yourself."

to find inputs that crashes binaries, among other things.

## Execution
On the *Setup* folder run:
```bash
vagrant up --provision
```

After this, when the machines are up, it will open a virtual machine that is the client, and will ask for the credentials:
login: **vagrant** and password: **vagrant**.
When logged in just enter the command to initialize the interface
```bash
cd client
```
and then
```bash
./gui.sh
```

After initializing the interface Xfce, open the Firefox app and open the web site **192.168.50.10**. This will open the scoreboard web interface.
